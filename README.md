Welcome to Rolling Chassis!
===================

Every enterprise grade web application has some common requirements that you need to implement. In my experience, I created many enterprise web applications for our esteemed clients. The one thing that I felt lacking was that there is no single skeleton available which does all these heavy lifting for the standard features. However due to diversity of technology, framework and requirement, creating such skeleton is not as easy as it looks.
 
I created this project as an attempt to provide a skeleton for enterprise grade web application by implementing common functionalities. Business features and functionalities can be added further as per product requirement.

> **Common Features:**
> - A basic project structure with tooling setup required for development.
> - A design guideline to be followed and framework for implementing same in the project.
> - A charting library/framework to create impact-full visualizations.
> - Internalization support (i18n/l10n)
> - A basic UI-Layout with options for common user actions like Navigation, Logout, Notifications, Profile Update etc.
> - A secure access to the application by user authentication and session management.
> - User Management (CRUD Operations) - If users are maintained in current application.
> - Role Management (CRUD Operations)
> - User access control (RBAC)
> - Supporting hooks for common functionalities like loading, back-end call interception, lazy loading etc.
